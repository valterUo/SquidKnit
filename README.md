# SquidKnit: Circuit knitting with quantum and classical communication using SquidQASM

#### Valter Uotila, PhD student, University of Helsinki

Summary: Scaling up qubit number and their connectivity is a huge challange for quantum hardware developers. The recent research has proposed circuit knitting as a solution. In this work, I study the circuit knitting scheme for Clifford gates. In other words, circuit knitting means a teleportation scheme which teleports two states through a Clifford gate and automatically applies the needed correction operation. In the future circuit knitting could be performed accross distributed quantum computers connected in quantum internet.
